usage: 
assistant helps with printing a6 verical format pdf labels (like inpost label) on a4 sheet.
each quarter is one a6 format. clik on rectangle to load pdf. then ctrl+p to print.
if you have focus on pdf view, then you will be printing only this one pdf- we don't want that.
click white background to loose focus and the ctrl+p. turn off margins in browser print window options.
your files are NOT sent anywhere- it's easy to check in network tab in devtools, plus- app code is public.

backlog:
1. print button // done
2. prevent focus on loaded view // done
3. make quarters draggable
4. add remove one/ remove all pdf
5. trim url
